## 🎯 What TESH-Query Does

Forget writing complex SQL queries. With TESH-Query, you simply ask for the data you need in plain English, and the tool handles the rest.

```bash
# Before: Crafting intricate SQL...
$ psql my_database -c "SELECT products.name, categories.category_name, orders.order_date FROM products JOIN order_items ON products.id = order_items.product_id JOIN orders ON order_items.order_id = orders.id JOIN categories ON products.category_id = categories.id WHERE categories.category_name = 'electronics' AND orders.order_date >= current_date - interval '1 month' ORDER BY orders.order_date DESC;"

# After: Just ask TESH-Query!
$ teshq query "Show me all high-value electronics orders from last month"

# Get instant, formatted results directly in your terminal:
┌────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────┬─────────────┐
│ Order ID   │ Product Name    │ Price     │ Order Date  │
├────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────┼─────────────┤
│ 12847      │ MacBook Pro M3  │ $2,499.00 │ 2025-04-15  │
│ 12923      │ OLED Monitor    │ $899.99   │ 2025-04-18  │
└────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────┴─────────────┘

## ▶️ Getting Started: A Quick Walkthrough

Ready to unlock your data? Follow these simple steps:

### 1. Installation

Install TESH-Query easily using pip:

```bash
pip install teshq
```

Confirm successful installation:

```bash
teshq --version
```

### 2. Configuration (One-Time Setup)

Run the interactive configuration wizards to set up your database connection and Gemini API key:

```bash
# Configure database connection details
teshq config --config-db
# you can also use `teshq config --db-url postgresql://myuser:********@localhost:5432/mydatabase`

# Configure your Google Gemini API key
teshq config --config-gemini
```
These commands will guide you through the necessary steps and securely store your credentials.

### 3. Database schema Introspection
```bash
# Perform database schema introspection
teshq introspect
```

### 4. Start Querying!

Once configured, you can immediately start asking questions in natural language:

```bash
teshq query "What are the names and email addresses of users who signed up last week?"
teshq query "Show me the total sales amount for each product category in the last quarter."
teshq query "Find orders placed by 'customer_email@example.com'."
```

TESH-Query takes your question, understands your database schema, generates the appropriate SQL, executes it, and displays the results in a formatted table.

## 🏗️ How It Works: Under the Hood

TESH-Query simplifies data access through a robust process:

1.  **Natural Language Input**: Your query is received via the CLI.
2.  **Configuration**: Secure database and AI credentials are loaded.
3.  **Database Connection**: A connection is made to your database using SQLAlchemy.
4.  **Schema Introspection**: TESH-Query inspects your database schema to understand tables, columns, and relationships.
5.  **AI Generation**: Your query and schema context are sent to Google Gemini (via Langchain) to generate optimized SQL.
6.  **SQL Execution**: The generated SQL is executed against your database.
7.  **Result Formatting**: Data is formatted into a clear, tabular output for the terminal.

### Architecture Overview:

The project is structured into key modules:

-   **`cli/`**: Handles command-line interface logic and user interaction (Typer).
-   **`core/`**: Contains core business logic, including AI interaction, SQL execution, and schema handling.
-   **`utils/`**: Provides shared utility functions (configuration, database helpers, formatting).
