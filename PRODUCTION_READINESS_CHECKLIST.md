## Deployment Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.9+ required
- All dependencies from requirements.txt installed
- Configuration files created (.env or config.json)

### Required Configuration
The following must be configured before deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key (format: 'AIza' followed by exactly 35 additional characters, total 39 characters)

Optional configuration:
- `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME` - Model to use (default: gemini-1.5-flash-latest)
- `STORAGE_BASE_PATH` - Base path for storage (default: teshq_storage)

### Pre-Deployment Validation

Run the production validation script:
```bash
python validate_production.py
```

Or use the CLI command:
```bash
teshq validate
```

Expected output when properly configured:
- ✅ Python Environment Validation
- ✅ Configuration Validation
- ✅ Security Validation
- ✅ Production Deployment Validation

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Review and update configuration for production environment
- [ ] Set production database URL (not localhost)
- [ ] Configure production API keys
- [ ] Set appropriate storage paths
- [ ] Review and configure connection pool settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery

### During Deployment
- [ ] Install all dependencies: `pip install -e .`
- [ ] Verify installation: `teshq --version`
- [ ] Configure application: `teshq config --interactive`
- [ ] Validate configuration: `teshq validate`
- [ ] Test database connection: `teshq database connect`
- [ ] Run schema introspection: `teshq introspect`
- [ ] Execute test query to verify functionality

### After Deployment
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Monitor API usage
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure alerting for errors
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Known Limitations

1. **AI-Generated Queries**: TESH-Query uses AI to generate SQL queries. While it has validation and safety measures, results should be verified for critical operations.

2. **Read-Only Operations Recommended**: For production use, consider using read-only database credentials to prevent accidental data modifications.

3. **Schema Changes**: If database schema changes, run `teshq introspect` again to update the schema cache.

4. **Development Mode**: Ensure the application is not running with development settings (localhost databases, debug logging) in production.

---

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -e .`
2. **Configuration Errors**: Run `teshq config validate` to check configuration
3. **Database Connection Errors**: Verify database URL and network connectivity
4. **API Key Errors**: Ensure API key follows the correct format (AIza... 39 chars)
