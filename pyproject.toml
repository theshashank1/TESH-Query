# [tool.setuptools.packages.find]
# where = ["src"]
# exclude = ["tests*"]

# This will write the version to a file, e.g., teshq/_version.py
# Adjust the path based on your project structure.
# If 'teshq' is your main package, this is a good place.
# You'll need to create a `teshq` directory with an `__init__.py` if it doesn't exist
# and you want to use it as a package.
# If your project is named "teshq", it's conventional to have a top-level package
# also named "teshq".
# Let's assume you'll create a minimal `teshq` package for this.
write_to = "teshq/_version.py"
# Example: write_to = "cli/_version.py" # If you prefer to put it in 'cli'

# You can customize the version scheme if needed, but defaults are often fine.
# e.g., version_scheme = "guess-next-dev"
# e.g., local_scheme = "node-and-date"
