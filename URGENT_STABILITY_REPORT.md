# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - TESH-Query Stability Report

## Summary

The TESH-Query repository has been analyzed for stability and readiness for stable release. **The repository is NOT READY for stable release** and requires significant work before it can be considered production-ready.

## âœ… Issues Fixed During Analysis

1. **CRITICAL**: Fixed `sqlite3` dependency issue in `pyproject.toml` 
2. **CRITICAL**: Fixed broken imports in `test-llm-execution.py`
3. **MINOR**: Fixed redundant exception handling in `main.py`

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Remaining

### 1. Test Coverage (SHOWSTOPPER)
- **Current State**: Almost no test coverage
- **Impact**: Cannot verify functionality or prevent regressions
- **Required**: Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### 2. Error Handling Strategy (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current State**: Good local error handling, no global strategy
- **Impact**: Unhandled exceptions could crash application
- **Required**: Global exception handling and user-friendly error messages
- **Timeline**: 1 week

### 3. Input Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current State**: Limited validation
- **Impact**: Invalid inputs could cause runtime errors
- **Required**: Comprehensive input validation for CLI and config
- **Timeline**: 1 week

## ðŸŸ¡ Recommendation

**DO NOT release as stable until critical issues are resolved.**

**Minimum development time needed: 3-4 weeks**

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement comprehensive test suite
2. **Week 2**: Add global error handling and input validation
3. **Week 3**: Performance testing and edge case handling
4. **Week 4**: Integration testing and documentation review

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Stable Release

- [ ] >80% test coverage with unit, integration, and e2e tests
- [ ] Global error handling with graceful degradation
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate
